# Facebook Clone

📘 A responsive Facebook clone built as part of a guided solo project from CodingPhase.

🛠️ Built with:
- HTML
- CSS (BEM Naming)
- Box Model
- Pseudo-elements

🎯 What I practiced:
- Writing clean, structured CSS using BEM
- Creating a responsive layout without frameworks
- Working with visual hierarchy and spacing
- Improving naming conventions and commenting code
